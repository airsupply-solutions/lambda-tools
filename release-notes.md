Release notes
=============

Version 0.2.0
-------------

### Test runner

*Not yet started.*

### `bundle` setting

Before creating the zip package, the files are copied into a "bundle"
directory. In previous releases of lambda-tools, this was created in a
temporary, randomly-named directory generated by the system, and the user had no
control over where it was saved. As of version 0.2.0, you can now specify where
the bundle will be created:

```yaml
functions:
  my_function:
    build:
      bundle: build/bundle
```

### `ltools clean` command

*Not yet implemented*

This will remove the bundle folder after running your tests.

Note: if you have not declared a `tests` section, the bundle folder will be
removed automatically after `ltools build` has completed. This preserves the
behaviour of version 0.1.

### Version 0.0 configuration is no longer supported.

The initial configuration format from version 0.0 is no longer supported.
Additionally, the version number tag at the start of the configuration file
is now optional.
